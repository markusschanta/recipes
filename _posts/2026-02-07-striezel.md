  # Prompt: A cinematic, ultra-high-resolution header image of a freshly baked, golden-brown Austrian Striezel (braided brioche) resting on a rustic wooden table. One end of the loaf is gently pulled apart to showcase the feathery, silky, and steamy interior texture. The crust is glossy and lacquered, topped with bright white pearl sugar. In the soft-focus background, there are subtle breakfast elements: a linen cloth, a small dish of creamy butter, a dusting of flour, and a warm cup of coffee. The lighting is soft morning sunlight coming from a window, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. --ar 3:2 --lens 85mm

Grab your flour—it’s time to bake the fluffiest loaf of your life!

## Ingredients

- 500g flour (all-purpose, preferably high-protein/Type 700)
- 250ml milk (lukewarm)
- yeast (1 packet dry yeast or 1/2 cube fresh yeast)
- 80g sugar
- 80g butter (room temperature)
- 3 eggs (2 yolks for the dough plus 1 yolk / 1 tbsp milk for the glaze)
- zest of 1/2 organic lemon
- 1 packet vanilla sugar
- salt
- pearl sugar (optional)

## Preparation

### 1. Prepare the Yeast (The "Dampfl")

* If using **fresh yeast**, crumble it into the lukewarm milk with 1 tsp of sugar and 2 tbsp of flour. Let it sit for 15 minutes until bubbly.
* If using **dry yeast**, mix it directly with the flour.

### 2. Mix and Knead 

* Combine **flour**, **sugar**, **vanilla**, **lemon zest**, and **salt**. Add the **yeast mixture**, **2 egg yolks**, and **softened butter**. 
* Knead for 8–10 minutes until the dough is smooth, elastic, and pulls away from the sides of the bowl.

### 3. First Rise 

* Cover and let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free spot for about 60 minutes (or until doubled in size).

### 4. Shape and Braid 

* Punch the dough down, divide it into three equal strands, and braid them into a loaf. Place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

### 5. Second Rise 

* Cover and let it rest for another 20–30 minutes. This is crucial for a fluffy texture!

### 6. The Glaze 

* Brush the Striezel generously with the egg yolk and milk mixture, then sprinkle with pearl sugar.

### 7. Bake 

* Preheat your oven to 170°C. Use your steam function (one steam shot at the beginning). Bake for 25–30 minutes until deep golden brown.

## Tips

* The Hollow Sound: Tap the bottom of the loaf; if it sounds hollow, it's done. 
* Better yet, use a thermometer to achieve an internal temp of 92°C–95°C.
* Cooling: Let it cool on a wire rack for at least 45 minutes to prevent the crumb from becoming "gummy."
* Elevation: For a richer flavor, let the dough rise in the fridge overnight instead of 1 hour in a warm spot.
