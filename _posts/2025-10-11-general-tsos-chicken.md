  # Prompt: Hero photo of General Tso’s chicken: ultra-crisp, craggy fried chicken pieces entirely glazed in a glossy mahogany-red sweet-savory sauce, garnished toasted sesame seeds. The chicken is entirely covered in the sauce. Served in a shallow white ceramic bowl over steamed rice with a side of bright-green broccoli. 45° angle on a matte slate surface, soft window light from the left, shallow depth of field (f/2.8), natural colors that emphasize warm reds and browns, visible steam and subtle sauce sheen. Include chopsticks resting nearby and a softly blurred rice bowl in the background. High-resolution editorial food photography, clean composition, no hands, no text, no watermark. --ar 3:2 --lens 85mm

Craving the takeout classic without the soggy letdown? This Food Lab–style General Tso’s delivers ultra-craggy, still-crisp chicken thanks to a clever vodka-spiked marinade and crumbly dredge, then coats it in a glossy, sweet-savory sauce of soy, Shaoxing wine, and rice vinegar. Garlic, ginger, and a kiss of dried chilies add warmth while a touch of sugar keeps everything in balance. <!--more--> Serve it over hot rice with steamed broccoli, showered with scallions and sesame, and enjoy that shatter-crisp bite that stays crunchy to the very last piece.

## Ingredients

### 1. For the Marinade
- 1 large egg white
- 30ml Chinese dark soy sauce
- 30ml Shaoxing wine
- 30ml 80-proof vodka
- 24g cornstarch
- ¼ teaspoon (1g) tsp baking soda
- 500g boneless, skinless chicken thighs

### 2. For the Dry Coating
- 64g all-purpose flour
- 64g cornstarch
- ½ teaspoon (2g) baking soda
- ½ teaspoon (1.5g) salt

### 3. To Fry Chicken
- 2l canola oil

### 4. For the Sauce
- 50g sugar
- 75ml chicken stock
- 75ml dark soy sauce
- 45ml Shaoxing wine
- 45ml rice vinegar
- 1½ tablespoons (12g) cornstarch
- 2 teaspoons (10ml) sesame oil

### 5. To Finish
- 4 teaspoons (20ml) canola oil
- 4 teaspoons (12g) minced garlic (about 4 medium cloves)
- 4 teaspoons (8g) minced fresh ginger (about one 1-inch piece)
- 4 teaspoons (8g) minced scallion bottoms (about 1 scallion)
- 12 small dried red chiles

## Preparation

### 1. Marinate the Chicken

* Beat egg white in a large bowl until broken down and lightly foamy. Add soy sauce, wine, and vodka and whisk to combine. 
* Set aside half of marinade in a small bowl.
* Add cornstarch and baking soda to the large bowl and whisk to combine. Add chicken to large bowl and turn with fingers to coat thoroughly. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside.

### 2. Prepare Dry Coating

* Combine flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk until homogeneous. Add reserved marinade and whisk until mixture has coarse, mealy clumps. Set aside.

### 3. Coat and Fry the Chicken

* Heat the frying oil to 177°C.
* Working one piece at a time, transfer chicken from marinade to dry coat mixture, tossing in between each addition to coat chicken.
* Lift chicken one piece at a time and carefully lower into hot oil (do not drop it!). Once all chicken is added, cook, agitating with long chopsticks or a metal spider, until chicken is cooked through and very crispy, about 4 minutes. Transfer chicken to a paper towel-lined bowl to drain.

### 4. Prepare the Sauce

* Combine sugar, chicken stock, soy sauce, wine, vinegar, cornstarch, and sesame oil in a small bowl and stir with a fork until cornstarch is dissolved and no lumps remain. Set aside.

### 5. Finish

* Combine oil, garlic, ginger, minced scallions, and red chiles in a wok or large skillet and place over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until vegetables are aromatic and soft, but not browned, about 3 minutes.
* Stir sauce mixture and add to wok, making sure to scrape out any sugar or starch that has sunk to the bottom of bowl. Cook, stirring, until sauce boils and thickens, about 1 minute.
* Add chicken to sauce, then toss, folding it with a wok spatula or silicone spatula until all pieces are thoroughly coated.
