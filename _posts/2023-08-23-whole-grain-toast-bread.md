  # Prompt: The image shows a loaf and several slices of soft, fluffy white bread with a golden-brown crust. The bread has a fine, airy crumb texture and a smooth, evenly baked crust with subtle diagonal grill-like markings. The loaf is nestled in a dark metal bread pan. The pan rests on a folded beige linen cloth atop a rustic wooden table, lit softly with warm, natural light to emphasize the bread’s inviting texture and color.
