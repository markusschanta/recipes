* ½ cup salt (preferably uniodised)

## Preparation

* Cut the cabbagge into 2 cm pieces and layer with the salt in a big bowl. Let it soak for 30 to 60 minutes.
* Rinse the cabbage with water 3 - 5 times until the cabbage has the desired saltiness (slightly more salty than seasoned spaghetti).
* Combine the cabbage, the rest of the vegetables and the sauce in a large bowl and transfer into a fermentation container.
