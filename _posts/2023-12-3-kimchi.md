Tangy, spicy, and packed with gut-friendly goodness, homemade kimchi is one of the most satisfying ferments you can make in your own kitchen. This recipe keeps things approachable while delivering all the vibrant flavor you’d expect — crisp napa cabbage, crunchy vegetables, and a punchy blend of garlic, ginger, and gochugaru. With just a bit of chopping, mixing, and patience while it ferments, you’ll have a jar full of fiery, probiotic-rich kimchi ready to brighten up any meal.

## Ingredients

* 1 head napa cabbage (approx. 1 kg)
* 500 g mixed firm vegetables (cut into bite-size pieces)
* 2 scallions (cut into 2" pieces)
* 3 cm piece ginger (peeled, finely grated)
* 5 garlic cloves (finely grated)
* 2 - 5 tbsp gochugaru
* 2 tbsp fish sauce
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1½ tsp sugar
* ½ cup salt (preferably uniodised)

## Preparation

* Mix the ginger, garlic, gochugaru, fish sauce, soy sauce and blend in a blender.
* Cut the cabbagge into 2 cm pieces and layer with the salt in a big bowl. Let it soak for 30 to 60 minutes.
* Rinse the cabbage with water 3 - 5 times until the cabbage has the desired saltiness (slightly more salty than seasoned spaghetti).
* Combine the cabbage, the rest of the vegetables and the sauce in a large bowl and transfer into a fermentation container.
* Ferment for 1 - 2 weeks at room temperature and transfer to the fridge afterwards.
